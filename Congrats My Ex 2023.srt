3
00:00:46,417 --> 00:00:48,917
-Hello.
-Still at work?

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,292
Yes, just a few more numbers.
Don't wait up.

5
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,583
-I'll text you when I get home.
-Okay.

6
00:00:54,667 --> 00:00:57,958
Oh, I came across a really
spooky ghost story.

7
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,042
You'll like it. I'm sending you the link.

8
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,917
All right. Bye.

9
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:10,458
This happened quite recently.

10
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:13,375
A friend of mine usually
stays late in the office

11
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,458
by herself to finish her work.

12
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:21,792
Then one night,

13
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:24,292
she was all alone as usual.

14
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:29,375
The time was about 10:15 p.m.

15
00:01:29,458 --> 00:01:31,833
Suddenly, the lights started flickering.

16
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:39,125
She didn't think too much of it.

17
00:01:42,083 --> 00:01:45,083
She thought it was just a brownout.

18
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:46,583
But then...

19
00:01:46,667 --> 00:01:48,250
all the lights went out.

20
00:01:54,083 --> 00:01:55,083
Shit.

21
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:40,708
Cue 3 completed. Next.

22
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:42,583
Guys, get ready for the surprise.

23
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:45,917
Mack, on your mark.

24
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,250
Time to pop the question.

25
00:02:54,917 --> 00:02:57,000
Will you marry me?

26
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,417
Shit! Shit! Shit!

27
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,167
Will you marry me?

28
00:03:21,667 --> 00:03:22,958
Yes!

29
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:27,292
Luckily, this clip has gone viral.

30
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:30,042
Or Mack and Pla
would have torn us to pieces.

31
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,500
Forget that,

32
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:33,667
we're lucky that Pla wasn't killed.

33
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,083
Wonder where that tuk-tuk came from.

34
00:03:36,542 --> 00:03:39,542
Aoffy, why didn't you block the road?

35
00:03:41,167 --> 00:03:43,667
I was playing the ghost, remember?

36
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,667
And got a full kick in the face.

37
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,833
You were there.

38
00:03:46,917 --> 00:03:48,875
-Why didn't you do it?
-Fatso.

39
00:03:48,958 --> 00:03:50,958
-You said...
-Enough, you guys.

40
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,042
We almost got them killed.

41
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,458
After the medical bills,
we barely have any profit.

42
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:59,125
Without new clients,
we'll have to drink water for meals.

43
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,708
-Don't worry.
-You've got a client?

44
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:03,625
I prayed to Khai the Child God.

45
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:07,625
Wait up.

46
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,000
Tell you what.

47
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,875
You're a superstitious freak.

48
00:04:10,958 --> 00:04:13,750
But it hasn't made your life better
in any way.

49
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:14,833
Go easy on it.

50
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,583
There's more?

51
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:19,708
Super sweet.

52
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:35,292
Your puke is so gross.

53
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,125
Can't you vomit like a lady?

54
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:39,750
There must be a wedding
that won't make you puke.

55
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,208
Maybe your wedding, Risa.

56
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:42,375
No way.

57
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,750
No way she'll puke?

58
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,833
No way she'll get married.

59
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,708
-Yeah, right.
-Yeah, rank.

60
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,750
I'll never get married in this lifetime.

61
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:56,750
Never say never.

62
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:00,125
There might be a knight on a white horse
who'll come and marry you.

63
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,458
If there's one for me,

64
00:05:02,542 --> 00:05:04,833
he must be real crazy.

65
00:05:04,917 --> 00:05:05,917
Let me tell you.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,667
I don't care about getting a husband.

67
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,750
Oh, yeah?

68
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,208
Bitches.

69
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:17,792
Hi, Chavee. What's up?

70
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:21,500
Oh, okay. Thank you.

71
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:24,375
-What is it?
-My prayers have been answered.

72
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:38,708
As if the whole world is
getting married at the same time.

73
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,500
My company has got
four weddings simultaneously.

74
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:47,458
I'm afraid of messing up
and receiving a complaint.

75
00:05:50,042 --> 00:05:52,167
Our companies have worked together,

76
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,667
will you do one of them?

77
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,417
I won't take any commission.

78
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,833
All the details on the Indian wedding,

79
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:12,708
I'll send you all the information
and be your consultant.

80
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:18,333
I'll also send Buay to help you.

81
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:20,875
-So, will you take...
-We'll do it.

82
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:23,375
Let her finish.

83
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,875
Or she'll know we're desperate.

84
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:28,125
The pay is in millions.

85
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,958
Deal! Pay the deposit now?

86
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:35,250
She's faster than me.

87
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,750
But we have never done an Indian wedding.

88
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,000
It's so easy.

89
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:43,250
It's all about M.S.P.

90
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,125
M.S.P.?

91
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:47,833
M.S.P.!

92
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,042
What is that?

93
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:54,750
M.S.P. stands for
Mehndi, Sangeet, and  Phere.

94
00:06:58,708 --> 00:06:59,917
Know what they are?

95
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,250
Beats me.

96
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:03,833
You don't have to worry about anything.

97
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:06,833
I'll show you previous wedding videos.

98
00:07:06,917 --> 00:07:09,583
They'll explain everything.

99
00:07:09,667 --> 00:07:12,083
-Do you...
-What is this? Very tasty!

100
00:07:12,167 --> 00:07:14,500
-Gulab jamun.
-Gulab jamun.

101
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,542
-Do you...
-Wow, nice color!

102
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,750
What is this?

103
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,042
That's jalebi.

104
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,083
-Do you...
-This one is so crispy.

105
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:22,417
That's a samosa.

106
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,125
Have it with masala tea
and you're in heaven!

107
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:27,292
-Do you...
-Wow!

108
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:30,542
Enough! I know you want to eat,
but we're discussing business.

109
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:32,250
I'm gonna kick you in the canal.

110
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,917
Goddess Kali has possessed Risa!

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,375
Don't say that. She's fiercer than Kali!

112
00:07:36,458 --> 00:07:38,250
You two are ganging up on me.

113
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,417
But do you have the couple's profile?

114
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Here.

115
00:07:46,042 --> 00:07:47,292
Shit!

116
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,667
Shit!

117
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,917
What is it?

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,167
Her ex-boyfriend.

119
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,250
Shit!

120
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:02,625
Okay, I'll be right there.

121
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,083
-Are they for Miss June's wedding?
-Yes

122
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,167
-Put them in the studio.
-Okay.

123
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:13,208
I heard you were so shocked to find out
that the groom is Mr. Arun.

124
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:14,542
How come?

125
00:08:16,417 --> 00:08:19,125
Here's the story, Buay.

126
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,333
Aoffy!

127
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:23,542
This is a love story
when you were still a baby

128
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,667
It happened years ago
and it's all so crazy

129
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:27,708
Risa just got her degree

130
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:30,042
Then she hurried to do overseas studies

131
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:36,208
In England our lady had to work for salary

132
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:38,292
Getting all dirty in a Thai eatery

133
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,333
Then one day she met a guy

134
00:08:40,417 --> 00:08:42,917
A handsome Indian guy by the name of Arun

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,667
Oh, yeah... yeah, namaste

136
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,792
He was a customer where she worked

137
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,917
Their eyes met and sparks flew all over

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,042
Young Arun became a regular

139
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,167
Lunch, dinner and sometimes supper

140
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:59,292
From hi customer, it became hi baby!

141
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,417
He was her shadow at work and parties

142
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Arun followed her like a puppy

143
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,500
They became such a happy couple!

144
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,917
For a year they were together

145
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,917
She believed he was the one

146
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,917
Well, he's so perfect, fine and clever

147
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,917
She was sure Arun was the one

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,917
But one day Arun said it's all over

149
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,917
Risa was shocked, struck by lightning

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,917
She thought they were fated to be together

151
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,333
Let's be friends, Risa

152
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:28,417
Be friends forever

153
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:35,792
No more laughter, no more...
Suddenly became...

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,792
Split by distance,
across the world, she's still

155
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,875
Since then Risa has never
looked at any man, she's still

156
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:48,125
Years went by, but she'll never
forget her man, she's still

157
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,250
Stop!

158
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,125
Don't listen to these clowns.

159
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,750
She's as fierce as a dog.

160
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:58,917
No. Dogs are as fierce as her.

161
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,208
How come Arun is getting married?

162
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:06,625
There's no hint at all on his Facebook.

163
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:09,125
Girl, you did not!

164
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,875
Are you spying on your ex?

165
00:10:11,708 --> 00:10:13,292
Pathetic.

166
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,375
You told me yourself

167
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,875
that Arun barely posts about
his personal life.

168
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:20,458
When you were together,
he never posted about it.

169
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:21,833
That I can relate to.

170
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:25,500
When I had eight boyfriends
simultaneously, I never posted too.

171
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,583
Humble-brag.

172
00:10:27,417 --> 00:10:30,333
Hell no! I won't organize Arun's wedding.

173
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,833
Listen, Ri.

174
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:07,125
The wedding takes three days
and the prep only a month.

175
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:10,417
You can do it for the money.
Just for the money.

176
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,208
Get it over and done with.

177
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,042
What's up with you?

178
00:12:32,125 --> 00:12:34,125
I'm trying to act natural.

179
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:35,500
Why so nervous?

180
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:37,375
You've met him during the prep

181
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,750
like how many times? Eight times?

182
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,750
On Zoom and face-to-face are not the same.

183
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,083
There they are.

184
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,208
-Hi.
-Hello.

185
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,917
What's wrong with her?

186
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:40,875
She's trying to act natural.

187
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,750
Hotter than our friend.

188
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,208
-I would choose her too.
-I heard that.

189
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,083
Ex-girlfriend vs. Wifey

190
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:16,583
Will we see a slap-fest?

191
00:14:17,167 --> 00:14:19,250
Stop being so melodramatic.

192
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,542
Stop listening to radio soaps too.

193
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,917
No slap-fest, trust me.

194
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:56,625
A thank-you galore,
is it ever going to end?

195
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:31,833
Ri!

196
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:34,833
I said we would keep an eye out for them.

197
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:36,875
But you are here spying on them!

198
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,083
Ridiculous.

199
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:40,792
I'm only making sure they're all right.

200
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,000
Right.

201
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:46,208
Wow, like in a romance film.

202
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:48,083
"My dear Mo,

203
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,958
"I'm so glad

204
00:15:51,042 --> 00:15:56,583
"you'll become my wife soon and forever."

205
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,250
Squeeze your voice.

206
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,458
Got it. Got it.

207
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:05,083
"I'm glad you'll be my hubby too.

208
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:09,208
"Tell me, how many babies should we have?"

209
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:23,625
See? God wants you to laugh.

210
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,292
He doesn't want you to stress.

211
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:28,500
God loves silly people like us.

212
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:29,708
Yeah?

213
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,083
Good aim.

214
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,292
One more and it would be so goddamn funny.

215
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:43,917
Dammit! Right on cue!

216
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,333
Stop. Don't mess with the crime scene.

217
00:16:51,042 --> 00:16:52,500
Help me!

218
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,708
Serves you right.

219
00:16:54,208 --> 00:16:55,833
This is nothing to him.

220
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:59,583
Tell him to take a painkiller
and massage it.

221
00:17:04,542 --> 00:17:06,167
Am I going to make it?

222
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Why are you calling so late, Jan?

223
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,667
It's morning already.

224
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,833
Open your eyes and look outside.

225
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,292
-What's up?
-We've got a problem.

226
00:17:29,167 --> 00:17:31,542
Problem? At this hour?

227
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:35,042
Yes, a problem at this hour.

228
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,750
The pre-wedding photographer
we've hired for the 1:00 p.m. shoot...

229
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,625
How's Chat?

230
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,625
All his bones are broken.

231
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:47,958
We are doomed.

232
00:17:48,042 --> 00:17:50,458
Then who is going to replace him?

233
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:52,042
The shoot is at 1:00 p.m.

234
00:17:52,125 --> 00:17:53,125
Did you call Kai?

235
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,208
He's a monk now.

236
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:55,708
-Moo?
-Now in Nepal.

237
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:57,083
-Siban?
-Now in an OR.

238
00:17:57,167 --> 00:17:58,667
-Tee?
-Died three months ago.

239
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,000
-Taew?
-Died before Tee.

240
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,583
So, nobody?

241
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:04,750
What about the average ones?

242
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:07,583
Even if there is one,
he wouldn't get here in time.

243
00:18:07,667 --> 00:18:09,750
It would take hours.

244
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,042
He wouldn't make it.

245
00:18:11,125 --> 00:18:13,875
Is there really no photographers
in Hua Hin?

246
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,792
Come on, keep looking!

247
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:16,833
I'm googling!

248
00:18:16,917 --> 00:18:19,917
Don't just pray. Get your phone out.

249
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I can't find any.

250
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,083
There must be someone.

251
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,875
I got one.

252
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,750
There is a top photographer
who lives in Hua Hin.

253
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,083
Who?

254
00:18:36,167 --> 00:18:38,208
That guy.

255
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,292
The chicken feet soup guy.

256
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:49,958
No way.

257
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,458
He might not be here anymore.

258
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:55,458
He's been here for three months.

259
00:18:55,542 --> 00:18:58,583
He just posted on Instagram
"Hua Hin, the land of clammy clams."

260
00:18:58,667 --> 00:19:00,500
So full of information, huh?

261
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,083
But why me? You guys know him too.

262
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:06,333
Jan and I have to go back to the hotel.

263
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:08,875
We can't leave Buay with the guests.

264
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,208
All you have to do is

265
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:12,583
-convince your boy...
-He's not my boy!

266
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:14,042
-The way you...
-Stop.

267
00:19:14,792 --> 00:19:15,958
Stop it!

268
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:19,333
We can't botch this million-baht deal.

269
00:19:19,417 --> 00:19:22,708
Not hundreds, not thousands.

270
00:19:22,792 --> 00:19:24,375
But a million!

271
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:25,708
A million!

272
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,250
Hey, wait!

273
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,792
-You really want me to go by myself?
-Yes!

274
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,500
And now,

275
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:41,250
brace yourself for a thrilling spectacle
from this guy.

276
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,542
The magician who David Copperfield
begged to be his student.

277
00:19:54,208 --> 00:19:57,625
The unrivaled master of magic!

278
00:20:19,792 --> 00:20:20,792
Tim!

279
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:21,958
Shit!

280
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:31,167
Tim!

281
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:33,458
Tim!

282
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,333
Out of the way.

283
00:20:35,417 --> 00:20:36,417
Sorry.

284
00:20:45,958 --> 00:20:46,958
Tim!

285
00:20:48,417 --> 00:20:49,583
Shit!

286
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,208
New career, but same old bike.

287
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:03,667
Please stand by.

288
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:06,042
We are getting a new photographer.

289
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,958
Go take photos of dogs and cats

290
00:21:08,042 --> 00:21:09,958
and whatever for now.

291
00:21:10,042 --> 00:21:11,292
-Jan.
-Yeah.

292
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,750
-Everything all right?
-Yes.

293
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:17,625
You think she can convince Tim?

294
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,583
No need to worry.

295
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:19,542
He agreed?

296
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:22,333
I found a shrine in the back
and made an offering.

297
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:23,667
Two roast ducks.

298
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,250
Tim will certainly come!

299
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,542
Come on! Help me out.

300
00:21:28,625 --> 00:21:30,000
-I'm begging you.
-No!

301
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,875
Read my lips. I'm done!

302
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,458
Done with photography?

303
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,542
Done with you forever!

304
00:21:40,417 --> 00:21:44,500
I'll pay you way more than
the going rate, okay?

305
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,292
I've got work to do.

306
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:47,958
No time to play with you.

307
00:21:49,958 --> 00:21:51,125
When did you get here?

308
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:53,375
Tomorrow, don't come back.

309
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,458
What? Why not?

310
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:57,708
You've got the nerve!

311
00:21:57,792 --> 00:22:01,458
Your show is so shitty.
Better off hiring a Chinese lion dance.

312
00:22:01,542 --> 00:22:04,542
Don't forget to return the costume.
It's expensive.

313
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:09,792
What's that smile?

314
00:22:12,458 --> 00:22:14,333
Tim! You're leaving?

315
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,458
Please help me out.

316
00:22:17,083 --> 00:22:19,708
Tim! Don't leave, please help me!

317
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:30,583
We're so dead.

318
00:22:30,667 --> 00:22:31,750
What should we do?

319
00:22:36,417 --> 00:22:39,250
Sitting here is not gonna help.

320
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:44,333
I'll go tell Arun that we have to
reschedule the shoot.

321
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:46,250
Either he'll understand

322
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:49,167
or we're doomed.

323
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,583
But I don't think we're doomed anymore.

324
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,792
Can we really get through this?

325
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,125
Why are you smiling?

326
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:38,000
Is that them? Must be.

327
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:49,417
Ready, guys?

328
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,167
Who is Junior?

329
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:46,917
How would I know?

330
00:25:47,333 --> 00:25:49,042
Junior, my boy.

331
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,708
You ever ask your wife,
whether she's hungry, or wants some snack?

332
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:56,000
Ri? Puking again?

333
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,500
Hold it. Please hold it.

334
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:05,208
Shit!

335
00:27:37,792 --> 00:27:40,292
Check the files
before sending them to Jan.

336
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:41,333
Okay.

337
00:27:41,417 --> 00:27:42,417
Thank you.

338
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:43,875
Wait.

339
00:27:43,958 --> 00:27:45,125
Where are you going?

340
00:27:45,208 --> 00:27:46,333
My job's done here.

341
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:48,375
Good, you're here.

342
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,625
You can pay me now.

343
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,083
How would you prefer?

344
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:53,833
Not yet. It's not finished.

345
00:27:53,917 --> 00:27:55,833
What are you talking about?

346
00:27:55,917 --> 00:27:58,458
Arun and Monica really like your photos.

347
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:00,375
They want you to take more

348
00:28:00,458 --> 00:28:03,542
and be in charge of
the whole wedding photography.

349
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:05,833
Nah. I'm leaving. Wire me the money.

350
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,333
Come on, please help me.

351
00:28:08,417 --> 00:28:11,250
You've already helped me out.
Just do it till the end.

352
00:28:11,333 --> 00:28:13,917
Not helping you. I helped Jan and Aoffy.

353
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:17,292
Get someone else for your ex's photos.

354
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,125
Wait.

355
00:28:20,625 --> 00:28:22,625
How do you know Arun is my ex?

356
00:28:22,708 --> 00:28:24,542
There, that girl told me.

357
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,500
Hey.

358
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:32,667
Don't leave.

359
00:28:33,042 --> 00:28:34,042
I beg you.

360
00:28:34,125 --> 00:28:36,292
I'll pay you 100,000 baht.

361
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:38,667
You can leave right after it's done.

362
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,917
I won't hold you back.

363
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,333
-I promise.
-Promise?

364
00:28:45,542 --> 00:28:48,833
No more promises since
the chicken feet soup joint.

365
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:51,417
We're both adults. Why did you bail?

366
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,583
You could have broken up
with me in person,

367
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:55,292
so I didn't have to waste 299 baht

368
00:28:55,375 --> 00:28:57,375
on that lousy chicken feet soup!

369
00:28:58,625 --> 00:28:59,792
I'm sorry then.

370
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,833
What's so funny?

371
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,000
You're unbelievable.

372
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,292
You've ghosted me for over a year.

373
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,875
You say sorry now
because you need my help?

374
00:29:16,958 --> 00:29:18,333
You're a she-devil.

375
00:29:18,417 --> 00:29:20,292
I'm not surprised why that Indian guy

376
00:29:20,375 --> 00:29:22,042
left you to marry someone else!

377
00:29:46,458 --> 00:29:47,458
Help!

378
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:50,958
Come on.

379
00:29:51,042 --> 00:29:53,792
Don't be a sissy. Can't you swim?
That's ridiculous.

380
00:29:56,417 --> 00:29:57,417
Shit!

381
00:29:58,167 --> 00:29:59,167
Help!

382
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,750
-The water is shallow!
-Help!

383
00:30:02,917 --> 00:30:05,708
Calm down. I'm here to help!

384
00:30:14,625 --> 00:30:16,708
Tim!

385
00:30:19,917 --> 00:30:21,500
I'm not dead.

386
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
You scared me.

387
00:31:25,542 --> 00:31:26,875
What a nightmare.

388
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,083
I dreamt I was drowning
and you dragged me up.

389
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:34,417
And I heard you tell your ex
that we're back together.

390
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,875
Are you crazy? Why did you tell him that?

391
00:31:40,958 --> 00:31:42,208
I don't know.

392
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:45,250
It just came out of my mouth.

393
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:50,167
Maybe I just wanted to say something
to shock Arun.

394
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,625
Where is my stuff? I'm leaving.

395
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:54,208
Tim!

396
00:31:54,292 --> 00:31:55,375
Please don't go!

397
00:31:55,458 --> 00:31:57,042
You shouldn't have told him that.

398
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,750
Can't you just forget it for now?

399
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,833
Here you are!

400
00:32:00,917 --> 00:32:03,208
I've been looking for you all over.

401
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:07,292
Wait. Why do you two
look like wet puppies?

402
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,333
Skip that.

403
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:14,542
Ri, shit just hit the fan again.

404
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:18,958
Shit? What could be worse than me
getting back with her?

405
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:20,750
I said skip that.

406
00:32:22,917 --> 00:32:26,708
What? You're back together?

407
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:30,708
Wow! Congratulations, chicken feet boy.

408
00:32:30,792 --> 00:32:33,958
Aoffy, what's the bad news?

409
00:32:34,042 --> 00:32:35,292
What happened?

410
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:38,458
The Sword Fighting show
we booked for the welcome show...

411
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:41,250
Remember Chat's motorcycle accident
with the pick-up truck?

412
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,958
Don't tell me...

413
00:32:48,042 --> 00:32:49,333
So dead!

414
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:52,167
Not dead yet.
Three of them are just bruised.

415
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:54,458
But one got a fractured hand.

416
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:55,750
Can't even lift a pencil.

417
00:32:55,833 --> 00:32:58,250
Damn. What do we do now?

418
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:00,625
Chavee mentioned it's really important.

419
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:05,208
The welcome show must impress
the guests on the first day.

420
00:33:05,292 --> 00:33:08,167
If you don't get it right,

421
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,292
the client will be totally pissed.

422
00:33:11,375 --> 00:33:14,208
They will complain, nag and pester you.

423
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,958
And you'll feel wrecked

424
00:33:16,042 --> 00:33:18,792
and ruined for the rest of event.

425
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:23,500
So, don't screw it up, no matter what.

426
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:24,917
So, what do we do?

427
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,083
Find another show?

428
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:28,250
Where can we find one now?

429
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:30,250
We don't have time anyway.

430
00:33:30,333 --> 00:33:33,417
Jan and the caravan of relatives
will arrive soon.

431
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,917
How about me?

432
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,750
I can do the belly dance. Look, look.

433
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,208
What?

434
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:54,208
No. Stop it.

435
00:33:54,292 --> 00:33:55,750
Don't give me that look.

436
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:59,875
-I said no.
-Pretty please.

437
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,542
No. Let go, let go.

438
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:06,125
Please, Mr. Magic Man.

439
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,708
Amazing. Let go.

440
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:09,292
-Come on.
-No.

441
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:10,708
Just one last time.

442
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,917
I get that he can take photos.

443
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,500
But sword fighting?

444
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:16,000
Tim is a jack-of-all-trades.
He can do just about anything.

445
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:19,542
He can do everything except swimming.

446
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,417
What do you mean, Aoffy?

447
00:35:32,917 --> 00:35:34,333
He's killing it!

448
00:35:34,417 --> 00:35:37,833
Thank you for going to Samed
and meeting Tim back then.

449
00:35:39,458 --> 00:35:42,458
Who goes to Samed to forget about an ex

450
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:45,083
but comes back with
a new, younger boyfriend?

451
00:35:45,167 --> 00:35:47,375
They both are my exes now.

452
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:48,583
But they're both back?

453
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:49,500
Enough.

454
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:08,958
I was trying to brag. Would he get it?

455
00:38:10,208 --> 00:38:11,375
I'm sure he would.

456
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:15,167
All the laughter,
but the eyes said it all.

457
00:38:15,833 --> 00:38:19,875
I'm proud of you, Risa.

458
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:21,792
You were so damn good.

459
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:25,792
Good afternoon.

460
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:42,958
Did you really say that to him?

461
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:45,750
Sure. And I felt so good.

462
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:48,333
You should've seen Arun's face.

463
00:38:48,417 --> 00:38:49,708
He looked dumbstruck.

464
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:53,167
But why did he ask you all that?

465
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:54,583
Or maybe...

466
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:56,542
Maybe what?

467
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,333
He's jealous?

468
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:00,417
No way!

469
00:39:00,917 --> 00:39:02,625
He's getting married.

470
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:04,458
Remember Bam's wedding?

471
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,750
-Bam who?
-Bam, that unfortunate bride.

472
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:09,708
Her groom announced on stage.

473
00:39:09,792 --> 00:39:11,708
"Honestly, I don't love Bam.

474
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:14,167
"I'm in love with Bob, my best man."

475
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,083
Now I remember.

476
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:17,542
That was a total disaster.

477
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,458
Only expenses, no income.

478
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:21,500
Gives me goosebumps.

479
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,500
Ri, please. Don't make Arun jealous
and ruin his wedding.

480
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,292
Try to be considerate.

481
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:31,667
I've got car payments.

482
00:39:32,667 --> 00:39:33,958
Please cooperate.

483
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:41,833
Is he really jealous?

484
00:39:42,625 --> 00:39:43,625
No way.

485
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:45,542
Why now?

486
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,625
-Can you pay me now?
-Wow.

487
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,125
You almost stabbed me.

488
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:59,000
Now you ask for money?

489
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:00,417
What's wrong with you?

490
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,000
Keep dropping things on me.

491
00:40:02,083 --> 00:40:04,542
Last time with the fire baton. Remember?

492
00:40:04,625 --> 00:40:06,208
Stop complaining.

493
00:40:06,292 --> 00:40:09,125
You just kicked me into the pool.
I almost drowned.

494
00:40:09,208 --> 00:40:10,417
That shallow pool?

495
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,708
Whatever. Pay me now.

496
00:40:12,792 --> 00:40:14,750
I'll do it when the job is done, bye.

497
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,167
Wait, wait, stop.

498
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,167
I won't fall for your
chicken feet soup trick again!

499
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,833
If you don't pay me now,

500
00:40:22,917 --> 00:40:25,500
I'll leave and tell Arun

501
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:28,000
that we're not back together.

502
00:40:29,083 --> 00:40:30,333
Can I scan for payment?

503
00:40:30,417 --> 00:40:31,500
Here.

504
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:34,542
-Done.
-Wait!

505
00:40:34,625 --> 00:40:35,917
What now?

506
00:40:36,833 --> 00:40:37,958
Where do I sleep?

507
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:39,792
Good question.

508
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:41,292
No rooms available.

509
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:44,000
Not even one?

510
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:46,958
-Maybe someone checked out early?
-I'm afraid not.

511
00:40:48,417 --> 00:40:49,792
Just give me any room.

512
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:52,708
A room with no AC, broken TV,
clogged toilet.

513
00:40:52,792 --> 00:40:54,375
Or even a haunted room.

514
00:40:54,458 --> 00:40:56,458
No shitty rooms like that, ma'am.

515
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:00,125
Stop pushing him.

516
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,833
-We can sleep together.
-No way!

517
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:04,833
We used to do that all the time.

518
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:06,167
You can't say that.

519
00:41:06,833 --> 00:41:07,958
He means

520
00:41:08,042 --> 00:41:11,000
we used to sleep in the same room.

521
00:41:11,083 --> 00:41:13,667
On a sofa and a bed, separately.

522
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,375
Just say we sleep together,
he wouldn't mind.

523
00:41:16,458 --> 00:41:18,208
-Not at all.
-See?

524
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,458
Maybe I can find a room at a nearby hotel.

525
00:41:38,917 --> 00:41:40,750
-Hey!
-What?

526
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,167
Help me out!

527
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,000
Really? Funny girl.

528
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:06,208
Hey.

529
00:44:08,833 --> 00:44:11,458
You can leave in a while.

530
00:44:11,542 --> 00:44:13,625
I told Aoffy to move to Jan's room.

531
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:15,083
You can take his room.

532
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,000
I prefer it here.

533
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:19,542
-Hey!
-"Hey" what?

534
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:23,708
If I run into your ex
or his thousand relatives outside,

535
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:26,000
would they believe we're a couple?

536
00:44:31,917 --> 00:44:33,125
What a mistake!

537
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:40,250
Which one? Lying we're a couple,

538
00:44:40,333 --> 00:44:42,625
or agreeing to be
your lover's wedding planner?

539
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:47,875
-What did you just say?
-What?

540
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:51,792
It's so obvious that you haven't
moved on from that Indian guy.

541
00:44:52,417 --> 00:44:53,542
That's not true!

542
00:44:53,625 --> 00:44:55,500
Liars have smelly armpits, you know?

543
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,375
Let me ask you.

544
00:45:06,375 --> 00:45:07,583
Don't you feel hurt?

545
00:45:13,167 --> 00:45:14,583
Why would I?

546
00:45:14,667 --> 00:45:16,417
I don't feel anything.

547
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,333
I'm doing this for the money,
just the money.

548
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:24,625
If you say so.

549
00:45:36,167 --> 00:45:37,250
Hey!

550
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:40,708
I thought I'd throw it at Arun.
But you deserve it more.

551
00:45:40,792 --> 00:45:41,958
You only have one?

552
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:43,917
Hey.

553
00:45:44,958 --> 00:45:46,500
Don't.

554
00:45:46,583 --> 00:45:47,583
Tim!

555
00:45:49,208 --> 00:45:50,208
It's my turn.

556
00:45:50,292 --> 00:45:52,458
-Tim, don't.
-You started it.

557
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,500
[bed thumping]

558
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:02,367
[in English] I sometimes wonder
if Dr. Varun put you
on the right medicines.

559
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:07,500
It's the wedding planner
and her boyfriend.

560
00:46:07,567 --> 00:46:10,400
Sometime back
they were fighting.

561
00:46:10,467 --> 00:46:13,467
And now... listen...

562
00:46:13,533 --> 00:46:17,533
the bed is
creaking so hard.

563
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,166
Boy!

564
00:46:34,033 --> 00:46:38,066
Hi, so I guess yesterday
was a lucky day.

565
00:46:38,133 --> 00:46:41,133
Arun and I watched
a tennis match
at Wimbledon.

566
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,000
And Arun happened
to catch the winning ball.

567
00:46:45,367 --> 00:46:47,600
Baby, what are you
doing to it?

568
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,667
I just want to give it
to you like...

569
00:46:53,233 --> 00:46:55,133
but let me finish this.

570
00:46:55,567 --> 00:46:59,266
-Well, let me see it.
-No. You're going to spoil it.

571
00:47:00,066 --> 00:47:03,100
-Let me... No, don't...
-Let me see, please, baby...

572
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:04,667
Babe, come back.

573
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,266
[soft music playing]

574
00:47:15,233 --> 00:47:16,233
[sighs]

575
00:47:23,734 --> 00:47:25,000
[sighs]

576
00:47:39,433 --> 00:47:40,667
[waves lapping]

577
00:48:03,875 --> 00:48:05,917
-Shit!
-Sorry, sorry.

578
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,750
I was practicing fire juggling.

579
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:10,000
Are you hurt?

580
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:14,375
No.

581
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:39,208
Hey. Heartbroken?

582
00:48:42,583 --> 00:48:43,792
How do you know?

583
00:48:43,875 --> 00:48:45,250
It's not hard to tell.

584
00:48:45,333 --> 00:48:48,875
People come to Samed either to get laid

585
00:48:49,542 --> 00:48:51,250
or to nurse their heartbreak.

586
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:56,500
Looking at you,

587
00:48:57,417 --> 00:48:59,250
I think it's the heartbreak.

588
00:48:59,792 --> 00:49:01,458
So smart, huh?

589
00:49:01,875 --> 00:49:03,625
And you? Why are you here?

590
00:49:05,792 --> 00:49:08,083
I don't belong to either camp.

591
00:49:08,917 --> 00:49:12,250
I quit my job and came here
to learn fire juggling.

592
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:14,500
Strange reason.

593
00:49:15,958 --> 00:49:16,958
How's that?

594
00:49:17,625 --> 00:49:19,375
Well, I get bored easily.

595
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:25,292
So I've been searching for something
that's best for me.

596
00:49:28,042 --> 00:49:29,042
Found it?

597
00:49:33,292 --> 00:49:34,583
I think I just did.

598
00:50:06,375 --> 00:50:07,375
Shit!

599
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,417
Please talk politely to
your back-together-ex-boyfriend.

600
00:50:16,292 --> 00:50:17,792
What did you just do to me?

601
00:50:17,875 --> 00:50:18,958
What did I do?

602
00:50:19,042 --> 00:50:21,625
I saw you laying down like a log.

603
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:24,125
I thought you died from a broken heart.

604
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:27,917
You poor thing.

605
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,833
My baby.

606
00:50:33,118 --> 00:50:34,535
I was just kidding.

607
00:50:34,625 --> 00:50:35,500
Let me change.

608
00:50:35,583 --> 00:50:36,833
No! Get out!

609
00:50:41,433 --> 00:50:43,133
[in English] Baby, come here.

610
00:50:43,633 --> 00:50:44,667
-Hi, guys.
-Hi.

611
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,250
You guys going
to have breakfast?

612
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,400
I was hoping to go over
the details of
the Mehndi ceremony.

613
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:52,700
Yeah.

614
00:50:52,767 --> 00:50:54,533
Did you guys sleep well?

615
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,367
I slept like a baby. I mean,
good job on finding
this location.

616
00:50:58,433 --> 00:51:00,233
The suite here
is amazing.

617
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,266
-Yes.
-Yeah. I think so.

618
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:06,233
But both of us, we didn't sleep
at all last night. Right, baby?

619
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,066
Oh, you!

620
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,333
Don't be shy, babe.

621
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:17,500
But I am!

622
00:51:17,567 --> 00:51:19,333
-Want more?
-No.

623
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,667
Guys.

624
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:24,333
Guys.

625
00:51:24,633 --> 00:51:27,166
Guys!

626
00:51:30,233 --> 00:51:33,667
Maybe we should
discuss the Mehndi
after breakfast.

627
00:51:33,734 --> 00:51:36,333
Yeah, I think
that's better.

628
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,266
-Mo?
-See you, guys. Bye.

629
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:40,600
Bye.

630
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:44,667
What did you do that for?

631
00:51:44,750 --> 00:51:46,750
Playing your boyfriend. Convincing?

632
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:51,250
Now I know how to have a good time here.

633
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,417
Playing your boyfriend is so fun.

634
00:51:58,125 --> 00:51:59,125
Key card?

635
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:00,750
-No.
-Huh?

636
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:03,333
What?

637
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,375
Hey! Come back.

638
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:11,583
Risa!

639
00:52:20,917 --> 00:52:22,417
In a Mehndi  ceremony,

640
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,583
relatives hand-paint henna
on the bride's hand.

641
00:52:25,667 --> 00:52:28,708
It signifies the bond at the wedding

642
00:52:28,792 --> 00:52:30,542
between the bride and groom,

643
00:52:30,625 --> 00:52:32,667
and their families.

644
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:35,958
The darker the henna paint,

645
00:52:36,042 --> 00:52:40,042
the deeper and more beautiful
the love of the couple will be.

646
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:56,333
Thanks for bringing the horse here.

647
00:53:56,417 --> 00:53:58,167
Please have dinner.

648
00:53:58,250 --> 00:54:00,333
Jan has it ready for you.

649
00:54:00,417 --> 00:54:01,500
-Thanks.
-Okay.

650
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:05,292
You guys.

651
00:57:05,833 --> 00:57:06,833
I have to go.

652
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:08,625
Where to?

653
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:10,417
To puke, Jan.

654
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,000
Mr. Karun kept pouring for me.
I can't handle it.

655
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:16,583
That's bad!

656
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:18,458
-Wait. Where're you going?
-What?

657
00:57:18,542 --> 00:57:21,083
I'm afraid Aoffy will be lonely
puking by himself.

658
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:23,417
-Really?
-Yes.

659
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,500
Let go of me.

660
00:57:25,292 --> 00:57:26,625
Aoffy, wait for me.

661
00:57:26,708 --> 00:57:29,083
This is typical of a  Sangeet party.

662
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:31,875
Despite telling Mr. Karun
I have this party to run,

663
00:57:31,958 --> 00:57:35,625
he still insisted I get drunk.

664
00:57:35,708 --> 00:57:37,875
Now I'm totally wasted.

665
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:40,833
Take this. Bye.

666
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,167
What?

667
00:57:44,250 --> 00:57:46,042
I'm hiding from Arun's father.

668
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:48,708
"Bottoms up, bottoms up."
Now I'm so drunk.

669
00:57:51,667 --> 00:57:54,000
What? Don't tell me...

670
00:57:54,958 --> 00:57:57,208
I'm plastered.

671
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,500
Excuse me.

672
00:58:53,917 --> 00:58:55,750
This is the real  Sangeet party.

673
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:57,583
If you don't get to drink or dance

674
00:58:57,667 --> 00:58:59,667
then you're not at the  Sangeet at all.

675
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:39,625
We should find an Indian guy to marry too,

676
00:59:39,708 --> 00:59:41,125
don't you think, Ri?

677
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:43,917
You're not her.

678
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:45,500
-Hey.
-Huh?

679
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:46,583
Where's Ri?

680
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,208
Same symptoms.

681
01:00:04,208 --> 01:00:06,833
Hey, you couldn't handle
your wound or what?

682
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:12,083
No! I just drank too much.

683
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:14,458
Oh, right... too many drinks.

684
01:00:14,958 --> 01:00:20,917
I thought seeing Arun and his wife-to-be
dancing together

685
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,500
was too heartbreaking.

686
01:00:22,583 --> 01:00:23,792
That's not the case?

687
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:28,708
Look, they said if anyone wants to dance,

688
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:30,792
they can pick an outfit from here.

689
01:00:31,750 --> 01:00:33,000
Wanna have a go?

690
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:36,875
Maybe Arun can get a taste
of his own medicine.

691
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,167
No. No way!

692
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,000
Scaredy-cat?

693
01:00:45,917 --> 01:00:47,750
Yeah, you're scared.

694
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:23,667
Let it beat faster

695
01:01:23,750 --> 01:01:25,875
Let the heart beat faster

696
01:01:29,208 --> 01:01:31,167
Let eyes gaze into each other

697
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:33,667
Let the shining eyes gaze into each other

698
01:01:36,750 --> 01:01:38,208
Let it beat faster

699
01:01:38,292 --> 01:01:40,375
Let the heart beat faster

700
01:01:40,458 --> 01:01:42,042
Let eyes gaze into each other

701
01:01:42,125 --> 01:01:44,042
Let the shining eyes gaze into each other

702
01:01:44,125 --> 01:01:45,500
With a little bit of love

703
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:47,292
Tinkle your earrings

704
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:49,292
Hearing their melody

705
01:01:49,375 --> 01:01:51,333
Heart claps in rhythm

706
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:52,833
I have come for you

707
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,875
To become yours

708
01:01:54,958 --> 01:02:00,042
Come let us now together say

709
01:02:01,375 --> 01:02:02,542
Hayi Shava

710
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:06,125
Let us celebrate love
Hayi Shava

711
01:02:07,542 --> 01:02:09,708
Everybody say
Hayi Shava

712
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:13,250
Make everyone dance
Hayi Shava

713
01:02:14,667 --> 01:02:17,833
Everybody say
Hayi Shava

714
01:02:19,958 --> 01:02:22,083
How am I to recognize

715
01:02:22,167 --> 01:02:23,792
In this world

716
01:02:23,875 --> 01:02:25,750
Who is the one made for me?

717
01:02:27,167 --> 01:02:29,167
Among so many strangers

718
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,833
Unknown characters and faces

719
01:02:30,917 --> 01:02:33,083
Who is the one who will become my soulmate

720
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:37,750
When you come across
that particular person

721
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:41,542
Nature whispers in your ear

722
01:02:41,625 --> 01:02:43,542
You then feel

723
01:02:43,625 --> 01:02:45,292
It is a message from God

724
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:47,042
It'll be a joyful swinging ride

725
01:02:47,125 --> 01:02:51,417
Morning and evening

726
01:02:52,333 --> 01:02:53,333
Hayi Shava

727
01:02:53,417 --> 01:02:55,000
Moving in circles

728
01:02:55,083 --> 01:02:56,833
Life is a whirlpool

729
01:02:56,917 --> 01:02:58,167
It keeps moving aimlessly

730
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,208
Till one meets one's life partner

731
01:03:00,292 --> 01:03:01,875
And when you find that person

732
01:03:01,958 --> 01:03:03,625
Something magical happens

733
01:03:03,708 --> 01:03:05,542
The person becomes part of your breath

734
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:07,583
Like the mingling fragrance of oud

735
01:03:20,292 --> 01:03:22,292
Let us celebrate love
Hayi Shava

736
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:26,000
Everybody say
Hayi Shava

737
01:03:27,458 --> 01:03:29,458
Make everybody dance
Hayi Shava

738
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:33,375
Put your hands up and say
Hayi Shava

739
01:03:34,625 --> 01:03:38,042
Everybody say
Hayi Shava

740
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:19,625
Oh, my nagging wife. Don't worry.

741
01:06:08,250 --> 01:06:11,667
Almost 5:00 a.m.
The guests are going back to their rooms.

742
01:06:11,750 --> 01:06:13,167
Go get some rest.

743
01:06:21,125 --> 01:06:24,250
So, how's Mr. Karun doing?

744
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:26,250
It's his medical condition.

745
01:06:26,333 --> 01:06:29,250
He's fine after taking his pills
and getting rest.

746
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:32,375
Good.

747
01:06:49,542 --> 01:06:52,042
Do you need to go puke?

748
01:06:54,625 --> 01:06:56,250
I want to thank you.

749
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,708
-For what?
-Everything.

750
01:07:00,792 --> 01:07:04,000
From taking photos
to saving Arun's father's life.

751
01:07:04,083 --> 01:07:07,167
Arun and his mother are grateful.

752
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:09,750
You're a real hero tonight.

753
01:07:17,417 --> 01:07:22,833
Speaking of it, Arun's parents
are a strange couple.

754
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:27,458
They bicker all the time.

755
01:07:27,542 --> 01:07:29,958
And yet they love each other very much.

756
01:07:30,417 --> 01:07:34,458
Soulmates or hell-mates,

757
01:07:35,167 --> 01:07:36,917
sometimes we never know.

758
01:07:39,250 --> 01:07:40,250
What about us?

759
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:43,500
What kind of couple are we?

760
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,292
What now?

761
01:07:58,375 --> 01:08:01,292
This wedding is a real rollercoaster.

762
01:08:01,375 --> 01:08:03,375
Ri.

763
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:08,875
Put that flashlight down.

764
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:13,458
-Ri, we have a blackout.
-What?

765
01:08:13,542 --> 01:08:14,833
Let's check on the guests.

766
01:08:14,917 --> 01:08:17,208
-Put the torch down.
-You won't see me.

767
01:08:18,167 --> 01:08:19,167
Come.

768
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,000
Hurry up.

769
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:27,500
The guests are waiting.

770
01:08:27,583 --> 01:08:29,767
-Can you fix it? Where to?
-Yes.

771
01:08:29,767 --> 01:08:29,875
-Can you fix it? Where to?
-Yes.
[in English] Excuse me.

772
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:30,767
[in English] Excuse me.

773
01:08:33,033 --> 01:08:34,100
Thank you.

774
01:08:38,667 --> 01:08:42,133
-Hello.
Here's a torch for you.
-Hi.

775
01:08:42,567 --> 01:08:45,333
Sorry for
the inconvenience.

776
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:48,467
-Power will be back soon.
-It's okay.

777
01:08:48,533 --> 01:08:49,767
-Sorry.
-Yeah.

778
01:08:50,033 --> 01:08:51,367
-Thank you.
-Bye.

779
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:14,500
Risa?

780
01:09:18,033 --> 01:09:20,333
I thought it was someone
bringing me ice.

781
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:24,033
No ice.
But I brought this for you.

782
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,633
-Just in case.
-Like a lucky charm?

783
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:30,767
Come in
for a minute?

784
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:32,567
Come, come.

785
01:09:46,633 --> 01:09:50,000
-I'll take it.
-No. I can put it here.

786
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:53,033
-Your drink.
-Thank you.

787
01:09:53,266 --> 01:09:55,000
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

788
01:09:56,166 --> 01:10:00,033
I just wanted to thank you,
for your boyfriend,
what he did there.

789
01:10:01,066 --> 01:10:02,467
So, when's
the wedding?

790
01:10:02,533 --> 01:10:04,734
[choking] [coughing]

791
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,166
Thank you.

792
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:34,734
I'd better go. Hand out torches
for the other guests.

793
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,333
Risa.

794
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:39,233
I have something
to confess.

795
01:10:40,500 --> 01:10:41,500
When I...

796
01:10:43,333 --> 01:10:46,433
When I broke up with you,
it's because I was afraid...

797
01:10:48,433 --> 01:10:50,567
that the distance
between us would

798
01:10:50,633 --> 01:10:52,533
just break things up.

799
01:10:56,633 --> 01:10:59,000
Risa, you were
my best friend.

800
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:03,066
I just didn't
wanna lose you.

801
01:11:04,633 --> 01:11:07,033
But I lost you
anyway, didn't I?

802
01:11:09,467 --> 01:11:12,533
Then I meet you here,
at my own wedding, and...

803
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,200
started having
all these doubts.

804
01:11:17,266 --> 01:11:18,433
It's as if

805
01:11:19,100 --> 01:11:20,567
the gods
were testing me.

806
01:11:21,433 --> 01:11:23,600
I'm here to marry
the woman I love.

807
01:11:26,066 --> 01:11:27,700
I'm presented
by the woman

808
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:30,266
I used to love.

809
01:11:31,633 --> 01:11:34,500
After this much time,
seeing you here...

810
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:39,533
talking to you just
makes me uncertain.

811
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,467
It makes me
uncertain, Risa.

812
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:45,600
Maybe...

813
01:11:48,266 --> 01:11:50,333
You're the woman
I used to love.

814
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,033
And still the woman
I love.

815
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,400
The lights are back.

816
01:12:15,266 --> 01:12:17,333
Uh...

817
01:12:19,133 --> 01:12:21,700
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have...

818
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:27,000
Risa, I just...

819
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,567
Mo-mo...

820
01:12:37,533 --> 01:12:39,467
Why put us
through all of this?

821
01:12:41,467 --> 01:12:45,066
I was waiting
for you to tell me
that she's your ex.

822
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:47,167
You knew?

823
01:12:49,467 --> 01:12:51,233
Everybody here
knows, Arun.

824
01:12:52,367 --> 01:12:55,200
Because I didn't say a word,
doesn't mean I'm an idiot.

825
01:12:55,266 --> 01:12:58,266
Mon, listen to me once.
It's not what it looks like.

826
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:00,667
This girl that you're still
dreaming of...

827
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:06,333
You better be with her.

828
01:13:06,400 --> 01:13:08,734
Monica,
listen to me once.

829
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:11,166
Monica!

830
01:13:11,233 --> 01:13:13,000
Monica, Monica!

831
01:13:13,667 --> 01:13:16,734
Monica!

832
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,166
Monica.

833
01:13:20,200 --> 01:13:22,533
Monica!

834
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,700
Monica!

835
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:26,633
Can you guys
just wait for me?

836
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:28,333
Risa!

837
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:30,500
[in Thai] Hold this.

838
01:13:33,433 --> 01:13:35,700
[in English] Monica!

839
01:13:36,233 --> 01:13:37,266
Monica!

840
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,166
Monica!

841
01:13:41,734 --> 01:13:42,767
Monica.

842
01:13:44,133 --> 01:13:45,767
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

843
01:13:46,033 --> 01:13:48,100
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

844
01:13:50,767 --> 01:13:53,200
Monica, Monica!

845
01:13:53,567 --> 01:13:54,633
What's happening?

846
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:58,367
Monica, wait!

847
01:14:00,066 --> 01:14:01,633
She's our
wedding planner.

848
01:14:01,734 --> 01:14:03,433
[all exclaim]

849
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:09,300
And that's her recently
got-back-together boyfriend.

850
01:14:09,567 --> 01:14:10,667
[all exclaim]

851
01:14:10,734 --> 01:14:12,266
Why are they running?

852
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:16,333
-That's a good question.
-Cheers!

853
01:14:16,400 --> 01:14:17,734
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

854
01:14:18,467 --> 01:14:21,734
Monica!

855
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,767
Monica!

856
01:14:27,367 --> 01:14:29,633
Mo-mo.

857
01:14:30,667 --> 01:14:33,433
Mo-mo.

858
01:14:33,533 --> 01:14:35,166
Monica.

859
01:14:35,533 --> 01:14:38,433
Monica, listen to me.
Please. I know
what it looks like...

860
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:40,333
I didn't literally mean it.

861
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,533
You weren't supposed
to find another girl
before we got married.

862
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:46,433
I know. But you said
marriage is a marathon.

863
01:14:46,500 --> 01:14:48,433
and now I am literally
running after you,
it's the long run.

864
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:49,533
Run the other way.

865
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:50,600
Mo-mo, no...

866
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,266
No. I'm not letting you go.

867
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:57,166
Monica! I'm sorry...

868
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:03,433
[screams]

[motorbike revving]

870
01:15:11,567 --> 01:15:14,100
Mo-mo,
I won't do it again...

871
01:15:14,166 --> 01:15:16,533
Why don't you get it?
I don't want to talk to you.

872
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:26,458
Risa, what are you doing up there?

873
01:15:27,083 --> 01:15:28,625
I don't know either!

874
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:30,750
Momo! I'm sorry.

875
01:15:36,417 --> 01:15:37,542
Motorcycle!

876
01:15:40,208 --> 01:15:41,208
Shit!

877
01:15:42,792 --> 01:15:43,792
Shit!

878
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:46,375
Hold on tight!

880
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,500
Monica!

881
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:10,500
Monica!

882
01:16:12,542 --> 01:16:13,708
Car!

883
01:16:32,417 --> 01:16:33,708
Risa!

884
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:44,250
Risa, you all right?

885
01:16:46,708 --> 01:16:48,708
Sure, I'm good.

886
01:16:50,567 --> 01:16:52,533
[in English] Are you trying
to kill me, Mo-mo?

887
01:16:54,066 --> 01:16:55,567
I'm not trying
to kill you.

888
01:16:55,633 --> 01:16:58,100
But to marry you
after what I just saw.

889
01:16:58,700 --> 01:17:01,367
-Mo-mo, listen. Listen to me.
-Not a chance.

890
01:17:01,433 --> 01:17:03,100
I know
what you're trying to say.

891
01:17:03,166 --> 01:17:05,133
I tried. I wanted
to come up to you.

892
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:07,433
I wanted to come up
and tell you...

893
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:10,633
tell you all about me and Risa.
But I was scared, my Mo-mo.

894
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:13,700
It would ruin everything.
I didn't know what to say.

895
01:17:13,767 --> 01:17:17,400
So the best idea
you could come up with
was you care for her

896
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:20,100
instead of letting
your future wife
know about it.

897
01:17:20,166 --> 01:17:21,233
Are you serious?

898
01:17:22,367 --> 01:17:24,767
Mo-mo, I messed up!

899
01:17:25,033 --> 01:17:26,700
I messed up.

900
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,133
Please, listen to me.
Please.

901
01:17:30,467 --> 01:17:33,567
What you saw in the room
wasn't real, Mo-mo.

902
01:17:33,633 --> 01:17:35,433
I don't know
why it happened.

903
01:17:35,500 --> 01:17:38,700
Trust me... There's one thing
I know for sure, my Mo-mo.

904
01:17:40,734 --> 01:17:42,600
You're the one
I truly want.

905
01:17:45,333 --> 01:17:47,200
I don't want
to hear it, Arun.

906
01:17:47,266 --> 01:17:50,767
I don't trust a word that's
coming out of that mouth.
Get me?

907
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:52,400
Mo-mo!

908
01:17:54,233 --> 01:17:57,500
If you don't believe him,
can you just try to believe me?

909
01:17:59,233 --> 01:18:02,467
When I found out
I'd be planning
for your wedding,

910
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,667
I thought I took
this job for money.

911
01:18:05,734 --> 01:18:08,000
At least, that's what
I told everyone.

912
01:18:08,066 --> 01:18:12,033
But deep down,
I did it because...

913
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:14,667
I wanted to be
near Arun.

914
01:18:20,667 --> 01:18:23,033
Maybe, secretly,

915
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:27,300
the dumb, dreamy-eyed girl
in me has some wild dream

916
01:18:27,367 --> 01:18:29,233
that Arun
might feel the same.

917
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,734
But I was wrong.

918
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,300
And I was so stupid
for thinking that.

919
01:18:37,533 --> 01:18:39,133
I don't
want Arun back.

920
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:41,300
And he doesn't
want me either.

921
01:18:41,633 --> 01:18:43,500
I saw it in his eyes

922
01:18:43,567 --> 01:18:46,100
when he stopped himself
from kissing me.

923
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:53,600
And when I saw him jump
in front of the car,

924
01:18:54,467 --> 01:18:56,233
that's when
I knew for sure.

925
01:18:57,333 --> 01:19:01,133
No man risks his life,
hanging inches from death,

926
01:19:01,633 --> 01:19:03,533
just to win back
any woman.

927
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:06,300
He did it
because he's crazy

928
01:19:07,033 --> 01:19:10,600
and deeply and truly
in love with you.

929
01:19:13,433 --> 01:19:16,033
And now I know it's really
time for me to move on.

930
01:19:26,917 --> 01:19:28,333
Really?

931
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:32,266
[in English] Wait, wait.

932
01:19:33,166 --> 01:19:36,166
If you don't want
to listen to them,
can you listen to me?

933
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,400
What's wrong
with you people?

934
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,333
Can you remember
when you asked me

935
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,567
what is the best photo
of you and Arun?

936
01:19:44,633 --> 01:19:46,166
I'm telling you.

937
01:19:46,233 --> 01:19:48,500
There's none.
Your wedding day photos...

938
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:51,166
are just a part of your story.

939
01:19:51,233 --> 01:19:54,467
But your best photos come
after your wedding day.

940
01:19:55,233 --> 01:19:57,633
When you guys start
spending your lives together

941
01:19:58,467 --> 01:20:00,066
through thick and thin.

942
01:20:03,200 --> 01:20:05,433
Before you decide
to give up on him,

943
01:20:06,567 --> 01:20:09,567
please think about
all the beautiful photos

944
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,700
you'll never share.

945
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,066
Just think of it.

946
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:26,300
Mo-mo, Mo-mo!

947
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:30,000
There's still a few hours
until the ceremony.

948
01:20:32,467 --> 01:20:33,467
Give her time.

949
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:47,667
So what are we going to do now?

950
01:20:49,458 --> 01:20:51,958
We can only hope Monica will show up.

951
01:20:53,208 --> 01:20:54,417
If she doesn't,

952
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,583
it will all be over for us.

953
01:21:00,542 --> 01:21:01,667
And what about you?

954
01:21:02,333 --> 01:21:04,333
Like I said to Monica.

955
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,500
Now I know

956
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,875
it's time to let go of this tennis ball.

957
01:21:26,083 --> 01:21:27,083
Ri,

958
01:21:27,167 --> 01:21:28,375
that's not "let go."

959
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:30,042
That's an ace.

960
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:36,125
You know what? That actually felt good!

961
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:55,875
So Monica's not showing up?

962
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:04,600
[in English] Dad,
I think it's time
to accept the truth.

[horse snorting]

964
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,333
She doesn't want
to marry me anymore.

965
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,750
Don't worry, son.

966
01:22:10,533 --> 01:22:13,633
God willing,
everything will be okay.

967
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:20,200
Everybody!

968
01:22:26,300 --> 01:22:28,100
Monica said yes.

969
01:22:28,367 --> 01:22:29,567
[all cheering]

970
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:33,567
And she's waiting
for the groom.

971
01:22:33,633 --> 01:22:35,333
Let's go!

972
01:22:37,667 --> 01:22:40,367
[fast paced

973
01:23:36,667 --> 01:23:39,033
Thanks for giving me
another chance.

974
01:23:39,100 --> 01:23:41,767
But I still want
those perfect pictures.

975
01:23:48,066 --> 01:23:50,533
[all cheering]

976
01:24:30,375 --> 01:24:31,792
This is weird.

977
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:35,667
I am watching them holding hands
and being oh-so-sweet.

978
01:24:35,750 --> 01:24:38,750
But I don't feel like puking anymore.

979
01:24:38,833 --> 01:24:40,208
That's good, isn't it?

980
01:24:42,792 --> 01:24:44,292
Hey, Chavee,

981
01:24:45,292 --> 01:24:47,917
why do they have to walk around the fire?

982
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:51,167
This is an authentic wedding ritual.

983
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:54,750
They will walk around the fire
seven times.

984
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:58,375
Each round symbolizes
a different commitment of the couple.

985
01:24:58,917 --> 01:25:04,542
They promise to love, respect,
and be honest to each other.

986
01:25:04,625 --> 01:25:07,917
And from today, they will build a family

987
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,833
and stick together through thick and thin.

988
01:25:10,917 --> 01:25:13,500
They vow to be best friends.

989
01:25:13,583 --> 01:25:19,000
And the husband promises to look after
his wife and their children.

990
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:23,125
Wait!

991
01:25:32,542 --> 01:25:33,625
What's the matter?

992
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:35,917
Move.

993
01:25:36,333 --> 01:25:37,667
Where are you going?

994
01:25:37,750 --> 01:25:39,042
Have you seen Tim?

995
01:25:53,625 --> 01:25:54,708
Hello there.

996
01:26:00,292 --> 01:26:02,125
At first, I wanted to call you.

997
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:03,833
But then...

998
01:26:05,292 --> 01:26:07,500
maybe it's better this way.

999
01:26:10,417 --> 01:26:12,625
The wedding will soon come to an end.

1000
01:26:14,458 --> 01:26:16,250
And it's time for me to leave.

1001
01:26:17,542 --> 01:26:20,917
Thanks for asking me to work on this job.

1002
01:26:22,042 --> 01:26:23,667
It was so much fun.

1003
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:28,375
But most importantly,
I got to be with you one more time.

1004
01:26:30,542 --> 01:26:33,667
I also have something to confess.

1005
01:26:34,417 --> 01:26:36,542
I accepted this job

1006
01:26:37,167 --> 01:26:39,000
not because I needed the money.

1007
01:26:40,750 --> 01:26:42,333
I took it because

1008
01:26:43,667 --> 01:26:45,750
I wanted to be close to you again.

1009
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:49,000
There is never a dull moment
when I'm with you.

1010
01:26:50,292 --> 01:26:51,917
And I'm happy for you

1011
01:26:52,458 --> 01:26:54,792
that you can finally move on from Arun.

1012
01:26:59,208 --> 01:27:00,667
It makes me realize

1013
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:03,583
that it's time for me
to move on from you too.

1014
01:27:07,083 --> 01:27:09,458
I hope you will meet a nice guy someday.

1015
01:27:09,542 --> 01:27:12,125
He may not be as perfect as Arun.

1016
01:27:13,125 --> 01:27:15,625
He may not be
a jack-of-all-trades like me.

1017
01:27:16,708 --> 01:27:18,875
As long as he loves you

1018
01:27:18,958 --> 01:27:21,000
as much as you love him...

1019
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:24,708
What is he on about?

1020
01:27:30,667 --> 01:27:31,750
Tim!

1021
01:28:18,583 --> 01:28:19,792
What are you doing?

1022
01:28:20,542 --> 01:28:22,125
What are  you doing?

1023
01:28:22,708 --> 01:28:24,167
Why the voice clip?

1024
01:28:30,333 --> 01:28:31,958
I'm too afraid to say it to you.

1025
01:28:37,167 --> 01:28:39,167
I might leave something out and...

1026
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:43,000
Let's eat chicken feet soup.

1027
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,000
Sure. You won't stand me up again?

1028
01:28:55,083 --> 01:28:58,500
Well... I'm not sure.

1029
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:05,375
But I think I've heard
the whisper of the gods.

1030
01:29:06,167 --> 01:29:08,458
It's telling me
not to let this one slip away.

"Whisper of the gods?"

1032
01:29:11,625 --> 01:29:14,458
It's a long story. I'll tell you later.

1033
01:29:16,708 --> 01:29:19,000
Now answer my question.

1034
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,417
Want to come with me?

1035
01:29:30,208 --> 01:29:32,208
Well, this jack-of-all-trades...

1036
01:29:38,333 --> 01:29:40,417
